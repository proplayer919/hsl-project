# HSL Project (Honeycomb Server Language)

HSL (Honeycomb + HTML) is a programming language that is designed to be easy to learn and use. It is a scripting language that converts java-like honeycomb code to java code. HSL uses it to turn HTML and Honeycomb into .jsp files to be run on a website. Recolite uses this same technique.
